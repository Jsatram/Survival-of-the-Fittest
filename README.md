# About
This simulation shows how a "fit" individual in a population has an increased chance of survival in its environment with limited resources. This program generates a population of individuals which is represented by the color dots and food which is represented by the small light blue dots. Each individual in the population has different traits varying from movement speed, size in diameter, eyesight illustrated by the white ring around the individual, and even how long it takes them to eat. The job of the population is to survive and reproduce if possible to the next generation. A new generation is made when all the available food has been eaten. To survive to the next generation one must eat at least one piece of food, if two or more are eaten by a single individual, then not only will it survive to the next generation, but it will reproduce and bring with it an exact copy of itself to the new generation to repeat the cycle again.
