# About
This simulation shows how a "fit" individual in a population has an increaced chance of survival in it's enviroment with limited resources. This program generates a population of individuals and food. Each individual in the population has different traits varying from speed, size, eyesight, and even how long it takes them to eat. The job of the population is to survive and reproduce if possible to the next generation. A new generation is made when all the avalible food has been eaten. To survive to the next generation one must eat atleast one piece of food, if two or more are eaten by a single individual then not only will it survive to the next generation but it will bring with it an exact copy of itself to the next generation.
